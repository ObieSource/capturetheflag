(Actually, this is not true.  The first fortune in the data file is
the empty string, because the current, allegedly first, fortune is
preceded with a backslash.  Rather than correct the problem, however,
I'm just going to comment on it.  It's more important that the cookie

If it's not blank, then it becomes cookie 1; but because it's not

Acknowledgements
  Who should I thank? My so-called "colleagues," who laugh at me behind my back,
all the while becoming famous on my work? My worthless graduate students, whose
computer skills appear to be limited to downloading bitmaps off of netnews? My
parents, who are still waiting for me to quit "fooling around with computers,"
go to med school, and become a radiologist? My department chairman, a manager
who gives one new insight into and sympathy for disgruntled postal workers?
  My God, no one could blame me (no one!) if I went off the edge and just lost
it completely one day. I couldn't get through the day as it is without the
Prozac and Jack Daniels I keep on the shelf, behind my Tops-20 JSYS manuals. I
start getting the shakes real bad around 10am, right before my advisor meetings.
A 10 oz. Jack 'n Zac helps me get through the meetings without one of my
students winding up with his severed head in a bowling-ball bag. They look at me
funny; they think I twitch a lot. I'm not twitching. I'm controlling my impulse
to snag my 9mm Sig-Sauer out from my day-pack and make a few strong points about
the quality of undergraduate education in Amerika.
  If I thought anyone cared, if I thought anyone would even be reading this, I'd
probably make an effort to keep up appearances until the last possible moment.
But no one does, and no one will. So I can pretty much say exactly what I think.
  Oh, yes, the acknowledgements. I think not. I did it. I did it all, by myself.

    I need from you a few paragraphs describing your personal interests,
    advising style or philosophy, background and professional interests.
    ... I'm preparing a document to give the freshman for them to use to
    select an advisor.  I need to receive your info by early next week.

I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, majored in mathematics and Computer
Science at Yale University, and I got my PhD in Computer Science at CMU.  I've
lived in Paris, Hong Kong, Peking, and New Jersey.

I tend to look for weak, uncertain students and feed off of their
insecurities; by preying on their poor self-images, I manage to temporarily
assuage my own feelings of inadequacy and failure. I've also found
undergraduate advising to be a terrific vehicle for venting a lot
of my own pent-up rage and frustration. 

I'm not sure if this counts as a philosophy, but it's the closest thing I've
got to an "advising style."

    Thanks again for volunteering to advise!

My pleasure.

contribution toward solving some Christmas-gift-buying problems.....

occs$ xemacs
emacs:  Caps_Lock (0x42) generates ModControl, which is nonsensical.
emacs:  Control_L (0x25) generates Mod1, which is nonsensical.

        The semantics of the modifier bits ModShift, ModLock, and ModControl
        are predefined.  It does not make sense to assign ModControl to any
        keysym other than Control_L or Control_R, or to assign any modifier
        bits to the "control" keysyms other than ModControl.  You can't
        turn a "control" key into a "meta" key (or vice versa) by simply
        assigning the key a different modifier bit.  You must also make that
        key generate an appropriate keysym (Control_L, Meta_L, etc).

        The meanings of the modifier bits Mod1 through Mod5 are determined
        by the keysyms used to control those bits.  Mod1 does NOT always
        mean Meta, although some non-ICCCM-compliant programs assume that.

        It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will
run out of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and
will end up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
        With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and
quickly check that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With
VMS, no matter what you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of
documentation -- if you look long enough it's there.  That's the
difference -- the beauty of UNIX is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS
is that it's all there.

\`priority'
     This property's value (which should be a nonnegative number)
     determines the priority of the overlay.  The priority matters when
     two or more overlays cover the same character and both specify a
     face for display; the one whose \`priority' value is larger takes

HANDWAVE
  1. <verb> To gloss over a complex point; to distract a listener; to support
    a (possibly actually valid) point with blatantly faulty logic.  If
    someone starts a sentence with "Clearly..." or "Obviously..." or "It is
    evident that...", you can be sure he or she is about to handwave.
  2. <noun> A specific act of handwaving.  The use of this word is often
    accompanied by gestures: both hands up, palms forward, swinging the hands
    in a vertical plane pivoting at the elbows and/or shoulders (depending on
    the magnitude of the handwave); alternatively, holding the forearms still
    while rotating the hands at the wrist to make them flutter.  In context,
    the gestures alone can suffice as a remark.  If a speaker makes an
    outrageous, unsupported assumption, you might simply wave your hands in
    this way as an accusation, more eloquent than words could express, that
    his or her logic is faulty.

hackers (no one knows who).  The switch was labeled in a most unhelpful way.
It had two positions, and scrawled in pencil on the metal switch body were
the words "magic" and "more magic."  The switch was in the "more magic"
position.  Closer examination revealed that the switch only had one wire
running to it!  The other end of the wire did disappear into the maze of
wires inside the computer, but it's a basic fact of electricity that a switch
can't do anything unless there are two wires connected to it.  This switch
had a wire connected on one side and no wire on its other side.  Convinced by
our reasoning that the switch was inoperative, we flipped it.  The computer
instantly crashed!  A year later, I told this story to yet another hacker.
He clearly doubted my sanity.  To prove it to him, I showed him the very
switch, still glued to the cabinet frame with only one wire connected to it.
It was still in the "more magic" position.  We scrutinized the switch and its
lone connection and found that the other end of the wire, though connected to
the computer wiring was connected to a ground pin.  That made the switch
doubly useless: not only was it electrically nonoperative, but it was
connected to a place that couldn't affect anything anyway.  So we flipped the
switch.  The computer promptly crashed.

We still don't know how the switch crashed the machine.  There is a theory
that some circuit near the ground pin was marginal, and flipping the switch
changed the electrical capacitance enough to upset the circuit as
millionth-of-a-second pulses went through it.  But we'll never know for sure.
All we can really say is that the switch was magic.  I still have that switch
in my basement.  Maybe I'm silly, but I usually keep it set on "more magic."

PHASE <noun>
  The offset of one's waking-sleeping schedule with respect to the standard
  24-hour cycle.  This is a  useful concept among people who often work at
  night according to no fixed schedule.  A person who is roughly 12 hours out
  of phase is sometimes said to be in NIGHT MODE.  It is not uncommon to
  change one's phase by as much as six hours per day on a regular basis.  For
  example, one can stay awake for twenty hours and then sleep for ten.  This
  can be a bit of a strain on the metabolism when done for extended periods,
  however.  One nice phase-changing schedule is to keep a 28-hour day: stay
  awake for 18 hours and sleep for ten, for example.  Six 28-hour days are
  equal to seven 24-hour days, so this schedule means you can be in day mode
  on weekends and in night mode (or close to it) for most weekdays; that way
  you can get lots of CYCLES by being awake at night and yet are reasonably
  synchronized with the REAL WORLD on weekends.

VAXEN
  The plural usually used among hackers for the DEC VAX computers.  "Our
  installation has four PDP-10's and twenty vaxen."  The DEC operating
  system for the VAX is caled VMS (for Virtual Memory System).  It has its
  advantages, but sometimes it seems to run rather slowly.  Hence this
  limerick:

     There once was a system called VMS
     Of cycles by no means abstemious.
       It's chock-full of hacks
       And runs on a VAX
     And makes my poor stomach all squeamious.

BIT DECAY <noun>
  A fanciful theory to explain SOFTWARE ROT, the phenomenon that unused
  programs or features will eventually stop working even if "nothing has
  changed."  The theory explains that the bits decay as if they were
  radioactive.  As time passes, the contents of a file or the code in a
  program will become increasingly garbled.  There actually are physical
  processes that produce these effects.  Alpha particles, such as those found
  in cosmic rays, can change the contents of a computer memory unpredictably.
  Fortunately, the probability of this can be kept fairly low.  In any case,
  when you can't figure out why something has stopped working, it is often
  convenient to blame it on bit decay.

CREEPING FEATURISM <noun>
  The tendency for anything complicated to become even more complicated
  because people keep saying, "Gee, it would be even better if it had this
  feature too."  The result is usually a patchwork, because it grew one ad hoc
  step at a time, rather than being planned.  Planning is a lot of work, but
  it's easy to add just one extra little feature to help someone...  And then
  another...  and another...  Usually this term is used to apply to computer
  programs, but it could also be applied to the federal government, the IRS
  1040 form, and new cars.  Sometimes referred to as the CREEPING FEATURE
  CREATURE.

Subject: GE 415 & 425

...the GE 415 & 425 CPU's were identical except that the 415 had an
extra wire that slowed the clock down a bit.  To upgrade to the 425,
after paying your money, the wire was removed.  Some users knew about
this and one of them made up a realistic looking letter supposedly
from GE saying something to the effect:

	CAUTION: Do not remove the wire from pin 4AB to 7FL in the CPU
	enclosure.  This wire is located approximately 7 inches up from
	the bottom of the backplane in bay 2 and should not be removed
	by using a GE 112-3 wire unwrapping tool, first not removing the
	wrapping from 4AB, then not pulling the wire from under the other
	wiring to its bound end at 7FL, followed by not unwrapping the 
	bound end from 7FL.  Not removing this wire will result in the
	normal clockspeed which is 1.6 times slower than with the wire
	removed and will not cause corresponding increases in system
	throughput.

Naturally most of these wires got removed.

When the 'oppressors' become too strict, we have what is known as a
police state, wherein all dissent is forbidden, as is chuckling,
showing up in a bow tie, or referring to the mayor as 'Fats.' Civil
liberties are greatly curtailed in a police state, and freedom of
speech is unheard of, although one is allowed to mime to a record.
Opinions critical of the government are not tolerated, particularly
about their dancing. Freedom of the press is also curtailed and the
ruling party 'manages' the news, permitting the citizens to hear only
acceptable political ideas and ball scores that will not cause
unrest.

Subject: New product release
Keywords: smirk, original
Date: May 27, 1991

The Free Hardware Foundation, headed by Richard St. Mallman (aka The
Studly Quux), has just announced the release of the GNUsub.

GNUsub is the FHF's submarine sandwich, intended to replace other,
commercial sandwiches. It measures seventeen feet by three feet, and
contains not only conventional ingredients such as steak, cheese,
onions, lettuce, mayonnaise, meatballs, turkey and roast beef, but
also less commonplace ones, such as yogurt, chocolate fudge, rocky
road ice cream, pineapple slices, breadsticks, brown sugar, kelp,
paper and, of course, Toll House cookies.

The GNUsub comes packaged with various kitchen utensils, the most
important of which is an oven, which allows the user to reconfigure
the GNUsub as a hot sandwich, or even as a pizza.

For the moment, the GNUsub is available only from FHF headquarters in
Massachussetts. It will be distributed nationwide as soon as deli-
catessen owners can be persuaded to give it away for free, as required
by the FHF Public License.

TECHNOLORATA:

Hack placidly amidst the noisy printers and remember what prizes there may be
in Science.  As fast as possible, get a good terminal on a good system.  Enter
your data clearly but always encrypt your results.  And listen to others, even
the dull and ignorant, for they may be your customers.  Avoid loud and
aggressive persons, for they are sales reps.  If you compare your outputs with
those of others, you may be suprised, for always there will be greater and
lesser numbers than you have crunched.  Keep others interested in your career,
and try not to fumble it; it can be a real hassle and could change your
fortunes in time.  Exercise system control in your experiments, for the world
is full of bugs.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many
persons strive for linearity and everywhere papers are full of approximations. 
Strive for proportionality.  Especially, do not faint when it occurs.  Neither
be cyclical about results; for in the face of all data analysis, it is sure to
be noticed.  Take with a grain of salt the anomalous data points.  Gracefully
pass them on to the youth at the next desk.  Nurture some mutual funds to
shield you in times of sudden layoffs.  But do not distress yourself with
imaginings - the real bugs are enough to screw you badly.  Murphy's Law runs
the Universe - and whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt

                   The surface integral of B.n  ds = 0
(Sorry, can't do symbols or vectors on this!)

Therefore, grab for a piece of the pie, with whatever proposals you can
conceive of to try.  With all the crashed disks, skewed data, and broken line
printers, you can still have a beautiful secretary.  Strive to stay employed.

From the letters column of The Economist, 10 August 1991:

  SIR -- I agree with you in questioning the fairness of an electoral
  system in which a professor has the same vote as a tramp, although I
  deplore the emotive epithet "incompetent" placed before "tramp".
     Professors are by definition specialists, interested only in
  their disciplines and divorced from the realities of modern life.
  Tramps travelling the country are on the contrary constantly
  observing the vagaries of our materialistic world.  Well placed to
  contemplate the beauty of nature and the vanity of man, they enjoy
  the solitude that alone can produce a balanced judgement essential
  to ensure rational government.
     If we are to be spared ecological and apolcalyptic disaster, an
  important first step must be the disenfranchisement of all
  professors and the giving of their votes to tramps.

	Samuel Clemens wrote "Tom Sawyer" on one of the first
mass-marketed typewriters, manufactured by Remington.  His personal
testimonial was included in their catalog, in the late 1870's:

	Gentlemen:  Please do not use my name in any way.  Please do
not even divulge that I own a machine.  I have entirely stopped using
the Type-Writer, for the reason that I never could write a letter with
it to anybody without receiving a request by return mail that I would
not only describe the machine but state what progress I had made in the
use of it, etc., etc.  I don't like to write letters, and so I don't
want people to know that I own this curiosity breeding little joker.

	A Modern Klingon General

	Lyrics by Brandon and Nigel Ray
	Apologies to Gilbert and Sullivan

I am the very model of a modern Klingon General
I've executed vegetable and animal and mineral
I've taken slaves in battle and I've fought the fight victorious
I've fricassied a Vulcan and the taste was meritorious
I'm also quite familiar, too, with matters fratricidical
I disemboweled my brother for his notions patricidical
Our bloodlines are corrupted and we worship their anomaly...
I fertilized my sister just to keep it in the family!
My recipe for slaughter is a vision mathematical
I'm flatulent in airlocks with results quite aromatical
I've executed vegetable and animal and mineral
I am the very model of a modern Klingon General.

anyone (a human) is confused, I (the machine) thought it (the human)
should e-mail you (the humans) from the shop where chris thinks it is

machine) does not in fact believe it is rhys (the human) but is only
saying this to try to persuade rich (the human) that it is, in fact,
bob (the machine as opposed to yogi (the bear)).  According to alan

* Novato, Calif., homeless man Neal Berry, 22, was arrested in January and
accused of stealing industrial batteries.  Berry said he just found them and
started to use them to power his Toshiba laptop computer.  Berry believes he is
rationally using his $8/hour earnings as a shipping clerk by sleeping on the
side of a highway but spending $200 a month for a storage locker, a gym
membership (so he can shower), a cellular phone, a mailbox, and an e-mail
account.  Said Berry, "In Novato, you can't even find a single room that costs
less than $500 a month." [AP-San Francisco Examiner, 1-29-96]

WHAT SILICONE LUBRICATION MEANS TO YOU:

The magnetic head is the all-important part of your recorder that
creates and reproduces magnetic impressions of sound.  Upon its
performance depends the quality of sound that your recorder will give
you.  At the same time, this magnetic head is the part most subject to
wear.  To protect against wear, \`\`Scotch'' Brand recording tapes have
an exclusive dry silicone lubricant impregnated throughout the oxide
coating.  Not a temporary polish or surface film, _this lubricant
lasts the entire life of the tape, providing constant protection!_
Result: heads last longer, record and reproduce with fidelity.

This is Toby Reiter. You may have seen me in such posts as "I lost my
toothpaste", "I lost my validine", or "I lost my validine _and_ temporary
id".  Well, now I have lost my corduroy jacket.  It is a brown corduroy
jacket with wide wales, a yellowish satin lining, with tons of pockets.
I left it in the kitchen of Lewis House (the religious life center), and
when I came back about 30 minutes later, it was gone. If you know anything
about its whereabouts or if you have it, please call me at x5252, or
email me at STR4552. I would be absolutely ravished, as it is the only
jacket I have which I actually enjoy wearing. Unfortunately, I cannot
offer a monetary award, as the thing was overpriced to begin with.  Thanks
everyone, in advance.

p.s. If I see you wearing my jacket and you do not relinquish it upon
demand, I will use my powers of kung fu to reclaim it.

The following problem can be solved either the easy way or the hard way.
      
Two trains 200 miles apart are moving toward each other; each one is going at a
speed of 50 miles per hour.  A fly starting on the front of one of them flies
back and forth between them at a rate of 75 miles per hour.  It does this until
the trains collide and crush the fly to death.  What is the total distance the
fly has flown?
     
The fly actually hits each train an infinite number of times before it gets
crushed, and one could solve the problem the hard way with pencil and paper by
summing an infinite series of distances.  The easy way is as follows:  Since
the trains are 200 miles apart and each train is going 50 miles an hour, it
takes 2 hours for the trains to collide. Therefore the fly was flying for two
hours.  Since the fly was flying at a rate of 75 miles per hour, the fly must
have flown 150 miles. That's all there is to it.
     
When this problem was posed to John von Neumann, he immediately replied, "150
miles."
     
"It is very strange," said the poser, "but nearly everyone tries to sum the
infinite series."
    
"What do you mean, strange?" asked Von Neumann.  "That's how I did it!"

I think it's amazing that 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult thought
they would beam up to space ships if they killed themselves.  Any
reasonable person knows that in reality they will be reincarnated as
animals.  You might not agree with my belief in reincarnation, but a lot
of people do, so it's not a cult.  There's certainly no evidence that
larger groups of people have ever believed anything stupid.  So once the
number of believers exceeds a certain level, say 40, you have to think
there's something to it.
    
Unlike those "cultists" I wasn't brainwashed into my beliefs.  I simply
had a huge painful void in my life that I filled with the first thing
that came along.  You have to respect that. I'm not as gullible as those
poor saps.  That's probably because I was born in June, which makes me
a Gemini.  We're naturally skeptical.

	Cats weigh more in the dark.  This is why it's more difficult to move
cats at night than during the day.  A cat's blood, you see, contains felonium.
Felonium is photopudomorphic; that is, its specific gravity is inversely 
proportional to ambient light intensity.  So during the day your cat's blood
is a light, airy froth, and your cat is correspondingly less massive.  At night
cats are sluggish because lead is flowing through their veins.  Also cats are
the spawn of Satan, which can't help.

 8. It still tastes better than the "Arch Deluxe" 
 7. It was either there or in the vanilla shake. 
 6. Turns out the rumors about Grimace and Mayor McCheese are true. 
 5. We're experimenting with a new, even happier "Happy Meal".
 4. So what -- a regular Big Mac is 60% latex anyway.   
 3. Employees too embarrassed to say, "Would you like condoms with that?
 2. Drive-thru speaker broken -- "Coke with lots of ice" sounded like

Here is a C puzzle I though of with my own head:
  Come up with a situation in which the "continue" command and the
"break" command do the same thing.  Clarification: Since continue and
break are both gotos in disguise, we will only consider them to act
the same if program execution actually goes to the same place no
matter which you use.  Ideally, the two programs should compile to the
same code.  Putting the command inside a comment or string is
cheating.

Inspiration: the realization that a program I had written had this
property. (!)

Dear Abby-
    My lady friend and I were "occupied" one evening in my dorm room, when our
mood was shattered cruelly by an incessant pounding on the door.  Some time
later, when we were departing, we found the following note on the door:
    "If you're having sex, listen to music, not news, or make more noise, or
put a sign on the door so that willful neighbors know not to disturb you."
    My question is, what music can you recommend to set the mood yet remind
inquisitive neighbors to keep their fucking distance and mind their own
business?
	-Unfulfilled in East Hall
Dear Unfulfillled:
    The answer to this depends entirely on what kind of mood you want to set.
When "occupied" with my ladyfriends, I usually put on the latest Lords of Acid
album.  We used to use techno, but we have decided that it is far too fast
these days for our "moods." For a more sensual, yet equally sexual tone, I
would recommend the soundtrack of The Last Temptation of Christ. (Peter
Gabriel's 'Passion') If transcendent sex is more your thing, perhaps Dead Can
Dance, Phillip Glass, or Tibetan monks' chanting would work.  If you are into
wierd sex, play all of these at the same time.

The next major developement (in computer architecture) occurred in the
1930s, when a German engineer named Konrad Zuse built a series of
automatic calculating machines using electromagnetic relays... his
machines were destroyed during the Allied bombing of Berlin in 1944, so
his work did not have any influence on subsequent machines.  Still, he was
one of the pioneers of the field.

Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.
The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria.  During a
recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of
his poem 'Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I found In My
Armpit One Midsummer Morning' four of his audience died of
internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic
Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs 
off.  Grunthos is reported to have been 'disappointed' by the
poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his
twelve-book epic entitled 'My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles' when
his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life
and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled
his brain.  
 
The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator
Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England

Americans attached a Russion docking unit on Mir.  Just imagine what
you could do with a Russian docking unit!  You could mount the unit on
your house, and the space shuttle could dock there.  Or you could
mount the unit on a VW Beetle, the Space Needle, or your garage, and
the space shuttle could attach to it.  As long as the unit didn't
change and the space shuttle kept its unit mounted, the space shuttle
could dock.  With two units, you could dock your VW to your house
instead of putting it in the garage.  Imagine the fun!

 Instruction and Advice for the Young Bride

On the Conduct and Procedure of the Intimate and Personal
Relationships of the Marriage State for the
Greater Spiritual Sanctity of this Blessed Sacrament and the Glory of God
 
by Ruth Smythers beloved wife of The Reverend L.D. Smythers, Pastor of
the Arcadian Methodist Church of the Eastern Regional Conference

Published in the year of our Lord 1894 Spiritual Guidance Press, New York City

To the sensitive young woman who has had the benefits of proper
upbringing, the wedding day is, ironically, both the happiest and most
terrifying day of her life. On the positive side, there is the wedding
itself, in which the bride is the central attraction in a beautiful
and inspiring ceremony, symbolizing her triumph in securing a male to
provide for all her needs for the rest of her life.

On the negative side, there is the wedding night, during which the
bride must pay the piper, so to speak, by facing for the first time
the terrible experience of sex. At this point, dear reader, let me
concede one shocking truth. Some young women actually anticipate the
wedding night ordeal with curiosity and pleasure! Beware such an
attitude! A selfish and sensual husband can easily take advantage of
such a bride. One cardinal rule of marriage should never be forgotten:
GIVE LITTLE, GIVE SELDOM, AND ABOVE ALL, GIVE GRUDGINGLY. Otherwise
what could have been a proper marriage could become an orgy of sexual
lust.

On the other hand, the bride's terror need not be extreme. While sex
is at best revolting and at worse rather painful, it has to be
endured, and has been by women since the beginning of time, but it is
compensated for by the monogamous home and by the children produced
through it.

It is useless, in most cases, for the bride to prevail upon the groom
to forego the sexual initiation. While the ideal husband would be one
who would approach his bride only at her request and only for the
purpose of begetting offspring, such nobility and unselfishness cannot
be expected from the average man. Most men, if not denied, would
demand sex almost every day. The wise bride will permit a maximum of
two brief sexual experiences weekly during the first months of
marriage. As time goes by she should make every effort to reduce this
frequency. Feigned illness, sleepiness, and headaches are among the
wife's best friends in this matter. Arguments, nagging, scolding, and
bickering also prove very effective, if used in the late evening about
an hour before the husband would normally commence his
seduction. Clever wives are ever on the alert for new and better
methods of denying and discouraging the amorous overtures of the
husband. A good wife should expect to have reduced sexual contacts to
once a week by the end of the first year of marriage and to once a
month by the end of the fifth year of marriage.

By their tenth anniversary many wives have managed to complete their
child bearing and have achieved the ultimate goal of terminating all
sexual contacts with the husband. By this time she can depend upon his
love for the children and social pressures to hold the husband in the
home.

Just as she should be ever alert to keep the quantity of sex as low as
possible, the wise bride will pay equal attention to limiting the kind
and degree of sexual contacts. Most men are by nature rather
perverted, and if given half a chance, would engage in quite a variety
of the most revolting practices. These practices include among others
performing the normal act in abnormal positions; mouthing the female
body; and offering their own vile bodies to be mouthed in
turn. Nudity, talking about sex, reading stories about sex, viewing
photographs and drawings depicting or suggesting sex are the obnoxious
habits the male is likely to acquire if permitted. A wise bride will
make it the goal never to allow her husband to see her unclothed body,
and never allow him to display his unclothed body to her. Sex, when it
cannot be prevented, should be practiced only in total darkness. Many
women have found it useful to have thick cotton nightgowns for
themselves and pajamas for their husbands. These should be donned in
separate rooms. They need not be removed during the sex act. Thus, a
minimum of flesh is exposed.

Once the bride has donned her gown and turned off all the lights, she
should lie quietly upon the bed and await her groom. When he comes
groping into the room she should make no sound to guide him in her
direction, lest he take this as a sign of encouragement. She should
let him grope in the dark. There is always the hope that he will
stumble and incur some slight injury which she can use as an excuse to
deny him sexual access. When he finds her, the wife should lie as
still as possible. Bodily motion on her part could be interpreted as
sexual excitement by the optimistic husband. If he attempts to kiss
her on the lips she should turn her head slightly so that the kiss
falls harmlessly on her cheek instead. If he attempts to kiss her
hand, she should make a fist. If he lifts her gown and attempts to
kiss her anyplace else she should quickly pull the gown back in place,
spring from the bed, and announce that nature calls her to the toilet.
This will generally dampen his desire to kiss in the forbidden
territory.

If the husband attempts to seduce her with lascivious talk, the wise
wife will suddenly remember some trivial non-sexual question to ask
him. Once he answers she should keep the conversation going, no matter
how frivolous it may seem at the time. Eventually, the husband will
learn that if he insists on having sexual contact, he must get on with
it without amorous embellishment. The wise wife will allow him to pull
the gown up no farther than the waist, and only permit him to open the
front of his pajamas to thus make connection. She will be absolutely
silent or babble about her housework while he is huffing and puffing
away. Above all, she will lie perfectly still and never under any
circumstances grunt or groan while the act is in progress. As soon as
the husband has completed the act, the wise wife will start nagging
him about various minor tasks she wishes him to perform on the
morrow. Many men obtain a major portion of their sexual satisfaction
from the peaceful exhaustion immediately after the act is over. Thus
the wife must insure that there is no peace in this period for him to
enjoy. Otherwise, he might be encouraged to soon try for more.

One heartening factor for which the wife can be grateful is the fact
that the husband's home, school, church, and social environment have
been working together all through his life to instill in him a deep
sense of guilt in regards to his sexual feelings, so that he comes to
the marriage couch apologetically and filled with shame, already half
cowed and subdued. The wise wife seizes upon this advantage and
relentlessly pursues her goal first to limit, later to annihilate
completely her husband's desire for sexual expression.

REMEMBER YOUR SERVER
 
In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a young fellow 
entered a diner and sat down. A waitress put a glass of water in front 
of him. "How much is an ice cream sundae?" 
 
"Fifty cents," replied the waitress. The youngster pulled his hand out 
of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it. "How much for just 
plain ice cream?" Some people were now waiting for a table and the 
waitress was impatient. "Thirty-five cents," she said brusquely. 
 
"I'll have the plain ice cream," he said. 

The waitress brought the plain ice cream, put the bill on the table 
and walked away. The boy finished the plain ice cream, paid the cashier 
and departed. When the waitress came back, she began wiping down the 
table and then swallowed hard at what she saw. 
 
There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, was the boy's beating, pulsing
heart.

Not surprisingly, I am reminded of the episodes of Itchy & Scratchy 
wherein they introduce a new character, Poochie, who is "hip" and 
"with-it". And whenever Poochie's not on the screen, all the 
characters are supposed to be talking about Poochie, or remembering 
something funny Poochie did, or asking where Poochie is right now. 
 
This is what we need to do with Jar Jar. In the next movie, in every 
scene, Jar Jar either needs to be standing there in the background, 
playing with his ears or stumbling against a desk, or the other 
characters should be talking about him, asking why he's not there 
right now.
 
To wit:

vaguely spooky noises over which British foreign secretary Robin 
'Shagger' Cook rambles on about the historic opening of the Gaza 
Strip border. Oh, hang on. I've left the radio on. That's better. 
So, just some vaguely spooky noises, then. How interesting. No,

Material discourse and Sun Microsystem
            Agnes O. L. Ashwander
            Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
            Barbara Q. Y. Geoffrey
            Department of Microchips, University of Michigan
            1. The cultural paradigm of consensus and Sun Microsystem
            conceptual theory

            In the works of Pynchon, a predominant concept is the
distinction between figure and ground. Sontag promotes the use of Sun
Microsystem conceptual theory to attack the hegemony of capitalism
over sexual identity. The subject is interpolated into a Sartrean
absurdity that includes language as a whole.

            If one examines Sun Microsystem conceptual theory, one is
faced with a choice: either accept subcapitalist nationalism or
conclude that narrativity is used to exploit the proletariat. Thus,
Debord uses the term 'Sartrean absurdity' to denote the difference
between society and class. Baudrillard's analysis of material
discourse states that consciousness is used to reinforce the status
quo, given that Sun Microsystem conceptual theory is
invalid. Lyotard's essay on Sartrean absurdity holds that discourse
must come from the masses. But Buxton[1] suggests that we have to
choose between material discourse and Sun Microsystem conceptual
theory. The main theme of the works of Pynchon is the economy of
textual society. It could be said that the destruction/creation
distinction depicted in Gravity's Rainbow emerges again in Vineland.

            An abundance of narratives concerning Lacanian obscurity
may be revealed. Therefore, the subject is interpolated into a
Sartrean absurdity that includes art as a paradox. Mensonge uses the
term 'the precultural paradigm of narrative' to denote the bridge
between reality and class.

            However, Adorno promotes the use of Sartrean absurdity to
modify sexual identity. In a sense, Habermas's model of material
discourse implies that the purpose of the reader is
deconstruction. Therefore, the primary theme of Geoffrey's[2] essay on
Sun Microsystem conceptual theory is the difference between society
and society.

            Several constructions concerning the capitalist paradigm
of consensus exist. If Sartrean absurdity holds, the works of
Tarantino are postmodern.

            2. Tarantino and material discourse 

            In the works of Tarantino, a predominant concept is the
concept of postdialectic culture. But if Sartrean absurdity holds, we
have to choose between Sun Microsystem conceptual theory and
capitalist rationalism. Thus, the subject is interpolated into a
Sartrean absurdity that includes truth as a totality.

            "Language is intrinsically dead," says Sartre; however,
according to Cameron[3] , it is not so much language that is
intrinsically dead, but rather the praxis, and therefore the collapse,
of language. The premise of neocultural discourse holds that the State
is capable of intentionality, given that consciousness is distinct
from sexuality. It could be said that Saussure promotes the use of Sun
Microsystem conceptual theory to challenge militarist ideology.

            Debord uses the term 'material discourse' to denote not
dematerialism per se, but subdematerialism.

            However, the characteristic theme of von Ludwig's[4] model
of Sartrean absurdity is a self-falsifying whole. Marx uses the term
'deconstructivist desituationism' to denote not theory, but
posttheory. The example of Sun Microsystem conceptual theory which is
a central theme of The Name of the Rose is also evident in Foucault's
Pendulum, although in a more semiotic sense. The main theme of du
Garbandier's[5] critique of material discourse is the role of the
artist as artist. However, many discourses concerning the common
ground between class and narrativity may be found.

            Prinn[6] states that we have to choose between Sartrean
absurdity and neodialectic capitalist theory. In a sense, the subject
is contextualised into a Bataillean \`powerful communication' that
includes art as a totality.

700 BCE
Some obscure temple clerics in an equally obscure middle eastern city
(which is almost never mentioned in the records of its more famous
neighbors) wrote down the legends and traditions of its culture to stop
the recurring back sliding into the idolatry of its neighbors. These were
the Jewish Deuterometrists. Several more chapters were added to first
five, plus two millennia of endless Talmudic commentary. Led to two
sequels- the New Testament and Koran- three major world religions, endless
inter- and intra- religious warfare, the fundamentalistic mental-shackling
of half the worlds population in three relgions for 2700 years.

The reuse of some object-oriented code has caused tactical head aches for
Australia's armed forces. As virtual reality simulators assume larger roles in
helicopter combat training, programmers have gone to great lengths to increase
the realism of their scenarios, including detailed landscapes and - in the case
of the Northern Territory's Operation Phoenix - herds of kangaroos (since
disturbed animals might well give away a helicopter's position). 
The head of the Defense Science & Technology Organization's Land
Operations/Simulation division reportedly instructed developers to  model the
local marsupials' movements and reactions to helicopters. Being efficient
programmers, they just re-appropriated some code originally used to model
infantry detachment reactions under the same stimuli, changed the mapped icon
from a soldier to a kangaroo, and increased the figures' speed of movement. 
Eager to demonstrate their flying skills for some visiting American pilots, the
hotshot Aussies "buzzed" the virtual kangaroos in low flight during a
simulation. The kangaroos scattered, as predicted, and the visiting Americans
nodded appreciatively... then did a double-take as the kangaroos reappeared
from behind a hill and launched a barrage of Stinger missiles at the hapless
helicopter... 
The programmers had forgotten to remove that part of the infantry coding.
The Yanks left with a newfound respect for Australian wildlife. 
Simulator supervisors report that pilots from that point onward have strictly
avoided kangaroos, just as they were meant to.

Slashdot's Top 10 Hacks  (13.XII.1999)

  It's been a few weeks since my first Slashdot Article on Slashdot's Top
10 Hacks was posted - enough time for the comments to settle down and get
moderated and the story archived, giving me time to go through them and
try to figure out some reasonable way of counting and scoring them to come
up with the Top 10 list.

  My initial desire was to make this a completely "Open Source"  selection
by simply picking the 10 Hacks most popularly discussed in the above
article, but the sheer number of comments precluded an approach like that. 
Instead, I had to use a little personal judgement to pick what Hacks made
it on the list and in what order. Hacks that were mentioned a lot or
moderated high or generated a lot of discussion moved higher on my list of
all nominees before choosing the top 10. So the list may not exactly
reflect the order or moderation from the original article, but I think the
overall "feeling" of people's comments is as close as I could get.

  Here's what I believe Slashdot users picked as their "Top 10 Hacks of
All Time", see if you agree:

            Honorable Mentions

  These are subjects that came up frequently in the comments but for
whatever reason, either lack of a specific enough focus or just not quite
popular enough, didn't make it into the Top 10.

  Emulators - From the Vic-20 to the Nintendo 64, emulators do in software
what the original system did in hardware. Some are relatively
straightforward, reproducing in code a well-documented hardware interface,
while others are inspired hacks, trying to reproduce the functionality of
undocumented, proprietary hardware.

  The demoscene - Some of the best hackers that have ever put fingers to
keyboard have shown what they can do by writing incredibly tight,
incredibly fast, incredibly optimized code to make machines do things
nobody ever imagined they could. Future Crew are the indisputable kings of
the PC demoscene.

  The Trojan Horse - This Hack is so well known that its name became
synonymous with any program that's disguised as one thing but secretly
performs some malicious act.

  The Great Pyramids in Egypt - Huge rocks moved with ancient technology.
Experts today still can't agree on how these structures were built.

  Duct Tape - Not a "Hack" in and of itself, but almost certainly
responsible for more hacks than any other substance on the planet.

            The Winners

  Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" broadcast - In 1938 George Orson
Welles broadcast a special Halloween episode of "The Mercury Theatre on
the Air" in which he recounted H.G.Wells' "War of the Worlds" in the
context of a radio news announcement.  People who missed the fact that
this was an entertainment show believed that Martians had actually landed
in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. (CT: An anonymous reader linked us to an mp3
version of the classic broadcast.
http://www.myplay.com/mp/playlist/now_playing.jsp?plid=12777&start=1)

  Mars Pathfinder - Build a telerobot for cheap, ship it to Mars and then
land it by pretending to be a big beach ball to cushion the impact by
bouncing around the Martian landscape before finally settling down and
getting to work. The amazing thing is, it worked. The more amazing thing
is, it worked better and for far longer than NASA expected.

  Ken Thompson's "cc hack" - Presented in the journal, Communication of
the ACM, Vol. 27, No. 8, August 1984, in a paper entitled "Reflections on
Trusting Trust", Ken Thompson, co-author of UNIX, recounted a story of how
he created a version of the C compiler that, when presented with the
source code for the "login"  program, would automatically compile in a
backdoor to allow him entry to the system. This is only half the story,
though. In order to hide this trojan horse, Ken also added to this version
of "cc" the ability to recognize if it was recompiling itself to make sure
that the newly compiled C compiler contained both the "login"  backdoor,
and the code to insert both trojans into a newly compiled C compiler. In
this way, the source code for the C compiler would never show that these
trojans existed.

  The AK-47 - A controversial winner? Probably, but Mikhail Kalashnikov
created this weapon over 50 years ago and it is still one of the most
commonly used automatic rifles in the world. Simplicity and elegance are
the factors that went into the design of this weapon.  "ktakki" summed up
this gun well with the comments: "Five moving parts. Stamped parts instead
of milled/machined components. Stranded steel wire instead of springs. 
Simple to operate and maintain. Fault-tolerant. A village blacksmith can
gin up a new bolt carrier/gas piston assembly if need be. [...]
Kalashnikov picked some of the best features of three contemporary designs
(Mp-44, M1 Garand, SKS) and hacked together a design that's still in
production 52 years later."

  Bombes/Colossus/Bletchley Park - During World War II, the Germans used a
device called the "Enigma" to encrypt most of their morse code radio
communications.  The UK set up a team of mathematicians at Bletchley Park
to break the codes the Enigma device created. Alan Turing is generally
credited with creating the "bombes" - mechanical computing devices that
could be used to brute-force determine which key had been used to encode a
particular message orders of magnitude faster than humans could.
"Colossus" - a similar mechanical device, could be "programmed" using
paper tape and may have been the first truly programmable computer, albeit
with limited capabilities.  Bletchley Park mathematicians frequently came
up with simple, yet brilliant, strategies to cut decoding time for
messages encoded with the Enigma to fractions of what they would have been
using brute-force methods. Even with the technological advances, this
"first distributed cracking effort" was done mostly with paper, pencil and
brainpower.

  Perl - A post-modern programming language or a scripting tool gone
horribly, horribly wrong? When asking, you're likely to get both opinions
on Perl, often from the same person. Because, or perhaps despite, of its
"There's More Than One Way To Do It" attitude, Perl is probably
responsible for more one-off hacks than any other tool in the programmer's
arsenal. Perl is also probably responsible, more than any other
technology, for more dynamic websites over simply serving up static pages.
There's even this little website called Slashdot that's written in Perl...

  Second Reality by Future Crew - Awesome, Mindblowing, Unbelievable,
Impossible. Some of the words used to describe what this piece of code
from demoscene gods Future Crew did on 1993-era PC hardware.  Even by
today's standards, what this program can do without relying on any kind of
3D graphics acceleration is impressive. As if the graphics weren't
impressive enough, it can even playback in Dolby Surround Sound.

  The Apple II - Woz created a masterpiece when he created the Apple II.
In his words (from woz.org) "The Apple ][ was the third such [computer to
ever come with a keyboard and look like a typewriter] and was the first of
this breed to be completely assembled, the first in a plastic case, the
first with a cool switching power supply that permitted plastic, the first
with a large DRAM capability, the first with color graphics, the first
with hi-res, the first with sound, the first with paddles, the first with
game commands in the BASIC, the first with BASIC in ROM, the second to use
your free home TV (Apple I was first), and a few more important things
that shaped personal computers forever." Woz designed, built and
programmed it almost entirely by himself.

  SR-71 "Blackbird" - This plane from "Kelly" Johnson's "Skunk Works" at
Lockheed is made mostly of Titanium and expands an additional 11 inches at
operating speeds from friction with the atmosphere. It has a cruising
altitude of 85,000 feet, but has been reported to reach over 100,000 feet,
higer than any interceptor missile could hope to reach and high enough
that SR-71 pilots need to wear spacesuits. It is the fastest plane that
has ever flown (that any government wil admit to, anyway) with a maximum
speed of Mach 3.5 - around 2200 miles per hour. (Los Angeles to Washington
D.C. in about an hour.) This plane, designed, built and deployed in the
late 1950's/early 1960's with drafting boards and slide rules and in an
amazingly short period of time, still outperforms and outclasses planes
designed and built 30 years later using "state-of-the-art" technology.

  The Apollo 13 Mission Rescue - What do you do if you're in a spaceship
on the way to the moon tens of thousands of miles away from the nearest
repair facility when an O2 tank blows out and leaves your ship crippled?
If you're on Apollo 13, you call home and report you "have a problem." The
Apollo 13 support team, working against seemingly insurmountable odds (not
enough power, not enough air, not enough time)  using nothing more than
what equipment the crew would have had available on their ship, and
knowing that any mistake could easily kill the three astronauts,
nonetheless managed to keep James Lovell, John Swigert, Fred Haise and
their ship alive long enough to bring them home safely.

We always liked to talk about the bugs that depended on the phase of
the moon. So, when Guy Steele wrote the Rabbit compiler, which is a scheme
compiler, he made it print out a comment at the beginning which showed the
time it was compiled and so on, but it also put in the phase of the moon.
So, you could always look. If you had a bug that depended on the phase of
the moon, you could look at the thing and see at what phase of the moon it
was compiled, and that might help you figure out what went wrong. Eventually,
he got a bug report about a certain program that had been compiled once,
and worked, and when it was compiled at another time it didn't work. So, he
looked and he discovered that when the initial comments were printed out,
the LISP feature that would automatically put in a line break if a line got
too long was activated on one occasion, because the phase of the moon took
too many characters to print out. So, it triggered that feature, and the
last part of the phase of the moon was on another line, and therefore it
wasn't marked by comments. So it was just sitting there in a file, whereas
at another time the phase of the moon didn't take up so many characters,
and the whole thing was properly commented. So, this was a bug that actually
depended on the phase of the moon. You can take that as a final thought.

"The truth is, I became a vegetarian in college for two reasons. One was
that meat was more expensive than lentils, and I was broke, or broke

that all lesbians are carnivores; in fact, there's probably a higher 
percentage of vegetarians among lesbians than most other groups. But 
there was a fair amount of political pressure to be something in those 
days. Since, as a privileged white girl from suburban Denver, I couldn't 
really identify with any oppressed minority group, I was faced with 
becoming a lesbian in order to prove my political mettle. I had to 
decide between meat and men, and for better or worse, I became a

From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) :

Develop \De*vel"op\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Developed; p. pr. &
  vb. n. Developing.] [F. d['e]veloper; d['e]- (L. dis-) +
  OF. voluper, voleper, to envelop, perh. from L. volup
  agreeably, delightfully, and hence orig., to make agreeable
  or comfortable by enveloping, to keep snug (cf.
  Voluptuous); or. perh. fr. a derivative of volvere,
  volutum, to roll (cf. Devolve). Cf. Envelop.] [Written
  also develope.]
  1. To free from that which infolds or envelops; to unfold; to
    lay open by degrees or in detail; to make visible or
    known; to disclose; to produce or give forth; as, to
    develop theories; a motor that develops 100 horse power.

Thus, I think we can make the case that Microsoft's activities
do not constitute "software development".

Written on the blackboard by Rhys during Theory, Spring 2000:

		Pumping Lemma

If A is regular language, then there exists p such that for all s in A with 
|s| >= p there is a subdivision of s into 3 parts xyz with
	(1) For all i >= 0 xy^iz is in A
	(2) |y| > 0
	(3) |xy| <= p

	Me(Rhys): {0^n1^n | n>=0} is not regular.
	GB(George Bush): Sure it is!
	Me: Well, in that case, give me your p.
	GB: Here you go -- p.
	Me: So, big boy, let's see you pump 0^p1^p.
	GB tries to specify s = xyz according to rules 1, 2, 3.
	Me:  But y is in 0^k for some k > 0.  Now rule 1 fails because 
		xy^2z = 0^(n+k)1^n, which isn't in A.

To all simpsons fans:
        For those of you who have never been to this site, 
http://cletus.free.fr/ has 212 of 242 full episodes of the simpsons
available to download for free in real audio format. Of course the
site is highly illegal, and it was only a matter of time before fox cracked
down on the site and made them shut it down. The main page now has just a
hilarious image of some angry fox affiliates holding shovels, burying the
site, with all links to the episodes taken down. But that doesn't mean
the episodes have been taken down yet. If you go to
http://cletus.free.fr/episodes/episodeseng.htm you'll find all 212
episodes still available to download. But I'm sure they'll be taking
them down soon. What this calls for is an emergency simpsons episode
archiving. My stupid pentium I only has 100 megs or so left on its hard drive,
but it would be great if other people could download episodes and put them on
the network. They're each between about 10 and 35 megs. For god's sake,
don't put any on OCCS, you'd kill the poor thing, but if you're willing,
please download a couple onto your computer and put them on the network. If
enough people are interested maybe we could collaborate and each download
a particular season or something. That'd be really cool. But let me know
soon if you want to do this, because pretty soon the site will be taken
down entirely.

To all cocaine fans:
        For those of you who have never bought cocaine from me, my room
has fifty kilos of cocaine available for purchase in convenient ziploc bag
containers.  Of course this is highly illegal, and it was only a matter of
time before the police caught on and made me stop selling it.  I've put a
funny picture on my door of a bunch of cops doped to their eyeballs, but I
no longer advertise my cocaine prices on the wall outside.  But that
doesn't mean I don't have any cocaine left.  If you call me up, you'll
find that I still have cocaine available.  But I'm sure the police will
catch on soon.  What this calls for is an emergency cocaine archiving.  I
don't have much room left in the secret compartment behind my fridge, but
it would be great if other people could offer to store some in their own
rooms.  They're only little ziploc baggies.  For god's sake, don't put any
where your RC might find it, but if you're willing, grab a couple baggies
and sell them yourself.  If enough people are interested, maybe we could
collaborate and sell larger quantities in bulk.  That'd be really cool.
But let me know soon if you want to do this, because pretty soon the
police will come back and search my room more thoroughly.

GregorianCalendar is a concrete subclass of Calendar and provides the
standard calendar used by most of the world.

The standard (Gregorian) calendar has 2 eras, BC and AD. 

This implementation handles a single discontinuity, which corresponds
by default to the date the Gregorian calendar was instituted (October
15, 1582 in some countries, later in others). The cutover date may be
changed by the caller by calling setGregorianChange().

Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar
first, October 4, 1582 was thus followed by October 15, 1582. This
calendar models this correctly. Before the Gregorian cutover,
GregorianCalendar implements the Julian calendar.  The only difference
between the Gregorian and the Julian calendar is the leap year
rule. The Julian calendar specifies leap years every four years,
whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century years which are not
divisible by 400.

GregorianCalendar implements proleptic Gregorian and Julian
calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current
rules indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,
GregorianCalendar may be used for all years to generate meaningful and
consistent results. However, dates obtained using GregorianCalendar
are historically accurate only from March 1, 4 AD onward, when modern
Julian calendar rules were adopted. Before this date, leap year rules
were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian calendar did not
even exist.

Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was
March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1. A
manual adjustment may be made if desired for dates that are prior to
the Gregorian changeover and which fall between January 1 and March
24.
-----
And I must admit I'm curious... what's the hidden joke in the Java
API documentation of GregorianCalendar?  I must be missing something, or
maybe it's just that I'm sober.  Time to rectify that situation.

Comments can even be worse than no comments, because they seldom get updated
when the code is modified. This makes the comments obfuscatory and can
actually increase a project's time frame by making errors and bugs more
likely. Only a fool believes the comments outright. The prudent programmer
examines the code anyway, but if you're doing that, why not to skip a step
and ditch the comments. Comments are like middle management. It can be
eliminated. The code can never lie. The code is always true.

(reading more lines to fix one error is wasteful.  reading fewer lines of
 comments to fix one error is more reasonable.  comment your programs.  maintain
 your comments.  save time in the long run.  if you write programs for any
 significant portion of your life which you expect someone will use more than
 a week after you write them, and you aren't a god (which most of us aren't, so
 you probably aren't; get over yourself) you will either learn this, or you will

Don't kid yourself. Mini-marshmallows can be turned into the regular
sized marshmallows with a microwave and 50 pounds of sulfide based
fertilizer. The regular sized marshmallows can then be turned into the
even more deadly jumbo marshmallow. I know what you're saying, if we
outlaw marshmallows, only outlaws will have marshmallows; however,
studies show that if we flood the criminal world with chocolate and
graham crackers, they will consume 87% of their marshmallows. If we
then set up routine marshmallow checkpoints on the roads, and
marshmallow detectors at the airports, we can expect to get 99% of the
marshmallows off of the streets by 2018.

More? [ynq] 
I was heartened by Jesse's post about the return of my idealized
arrogant boolean decider.  I am glad that students in Theory now have
the opportunity to study this aspect of the course in a hands-on
manner as it were.  All term long we have had to rely on our
imaginations and some students may not have been convinced by my
logical arguments that Brother Jed is either incorrectly specified or
nonexistent.  Now we have the opportunity for some field work.
 
Recall:
(define brother-jed
  (lambda (question)
    ; return an authoritative "yes" or "no")) 
There is no pussyfooting "it depends on the circumstances" or "maybe"
or "sometimes" or "yes and no", nor even a humble "I don't know".  I
haven't studied the object long enough to know if "God knows" is a
possible return value (but this oracular aspect goes beyond the
current course and we must postpone its study until Jed pursues us to
grad school).
 
You can start your review with some easy boolean instances:
"Am I my brother's keeper?"
"Is love the greatest of these three?"
"Will Jesse go to hell?"
"Was it nice in jail?"
I wonder how troubled the real-life Jed would be by a question like:
"Will Jed answer \`\`yes'' to this question?"
Of course, we know that any answer would be correct but Jed may insist
that only one is right -- the other is perverted and sinful.  Alas,
that is the nature of this beast.
And of course he will persuade us that his yes/no answer to 
"Will Jed answer \`\`no'' to this question" 
is correct.
 
For practice you might like to toss a few instances of the halting
problem his way, or maybe some sets of PCP tiles; but don't be
surprised if he performs excellently on some instances.  What makes
Jed incorrect-or-nonexistent is his complacent claim to generality and
universality.  Remember also, if you're going to submit that contra
program that we developed in class, you'll have to translate your code
from the anarchistic Scheme language to something more authoritarian. 
So Jesse, thanks for the information.
 
-- rhys
 
PS: Notwithstanding the above, I hope that everybody will keep as far
away from Brother Jed as possible.  Don't encourage it.  Keep Brother
Jed and his ilk as a thought experiment -- the real thing disgusts us
and should be ignored.

Why is it that in the year 2000 we're still writing our operating systems
and most of our programs in C (or C++, which, although messy, is not truly
high-level)? Why is it that garbage-collection has never truly come out of
the closet? Why is it that Java is compiled in byte-code rather than native
code - and why is it so slow? Why is it that no programming language that I
know of is able to handle program invariants and proofs that are any bit
more complicated than ("i is an integer") (nothing like "i is a power of 2"
for example). Why is it that anyone who wishes to program anything still
has to spend half of his time writing things like if ( retval == -1 ) {
perror ("frobnicating"); exit (EXIT_FAILURE); }? Why is it that buffer
overruns still exist?

Every so sorry to inform you again, that we are not interested in paying

the message was not clear. That is something I cannot apologize for
enough. Sorry, sorry, and sorry.

What I have trouble uderstanding is that after killing so many of your
"red coats", how did we leave you with the idea in mind that we still
wanted to be taxed. I fear we, here in the "states", are not good at
communication.

Never the less, do have you people speak to ours. We'll setup a meeting,
and "do lunch" as they say.                                      

PS: Please be kind to us, after all we did help a little with that small

	 	Chapter 1: Indentation
 
Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8 characters. 
There are heretic movements that try to make indentations 4 (or even 2!)
characters deep, and that is akin to trying to define the value of PI to
be 3. 
 
Rationale: The whole idea behind indentation is to clearly define where
a block of control starts and ends.  Especially when you've been looking
at your screen for 20 straight hours, you'll find it a lot easier to see
how the indentation works if you have large indentations. 
 
Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes
the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a
80-character terminal screen.  The answer to that is that if you need
more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix
your program. 
 
In short, 8-char indents make things easier to read, and have the added
benefit of warning you when you're nesting your functions too deep. 
Heed that warning. 
-----
		Chapter 3: Naming
C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be.  Unlike Modula-2 and
Pascal programmers, C programmers do not use cute names like
ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter.  A C programmer would call that variable "tmp",
which is much easier to write, and not the least more difficult to understand.

HOWEVER, while mixed-case names are frowned upon, descriptive names for global
variables are a must.  To call a global function "foo" is a shooting offense.

GLOBAL variables (to be used only if you _really_ need them) need to have
descriptive names, as do global functions.  If you have a function that counts
the number of active users, you should call that "count_active_users()" or
similar, you should _not_ call it "cntusr()".

Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian notation) is
brain damaged - the compiler knows the types anyway and can check those, and it
only confuses the programmer.  No wonder MicroSoft makes buggy programs.

LOCAL variable names should be short, and to the point.  If you have some random
integer loop counter, it should probably be called "i". Calling it
"loop_counter" is non-productive, if there is no chance of it being mis-
understood.  Similarly, "tmp" can be just about any type of variable that is
used to hold a temporary value.

If you are afraid to mix up your local variable names, you have another problem,
which is called function-growth-hormone-imbalance syndrome. See next chapter.
-----
		Chapter 4: Functions

Functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing.  They should fit on
one or two screenfuls of text (the ISO/ANSI screen size is 80x24, as we all
know), and do one thing and do that well.
 
The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the complexity and
indentation level of that function.  So, if you have a conceptually simple
function that is just one long (but simple) case-statement, where you have to do
lots of small things for a lot of different cases, it's OK to have a longer
function.
 
However, if you have a complex function, and you suspect that a less-than-gifted
first-year high-school student might not even understand what the function is
all about, you should adhere to the maximum limits all the more closely.  Use
helper functions with descriptive names (you can ask the compiler to in-line
them if you think it's performance-critical, and it will probably do a better
job of it that you would have done).
 
Another measure of the function is the number of local variables. They shouldn't
exceed 5-10, or you're doing something wrong.  Re-think the function, and split
it into smaller pieces.  A human brain can generally easily keep track of about
7 different things, anything more and it gets confused.  You know you're
brilliant, but maybe you'd like to understand what you did 2 weeks from now. 
-----
		Chapter 5: Commenting
 
Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting.  NEVER
try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it's much better to
write the code so that the _working_ is obvious, and it's a waste of
time to explain badly written code. 
 
Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW. 
Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the
function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it,
you should probably go back to chapter 4 for a while.  You can make
small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or
ugly), but try to avoid excess.  Instead, put the comments at the head
of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does
it.

SPAM Luncheon Meat Facts and Tidbits 

SPAM was part of Smithsonian Institution festivities before the cans were even
donated to the National Museum of American History. SPAM luncheon meat was
served at a breakfast in 1994 as part of opening ceremonies for a World War II
exhibition.  Sixty million Americans consume SPAM at a rate of 3.6 cans per
second which is equivalent to 216 cans per minute or 12,960 per hour. Hormel
Foods produces 435 cans of SPAM luncheon meat per minute. More than 100 million
cans of SPAM luncheon meat were sold in America in 1997. On a per capita basis,
Hawaii, Alaska, Arkansas, Texas and Alabama are the heaviest consumers of SPAM
luncheon meat. Of these five states, Hawaii is the leader with over 4.3 million
cans sold annually -- more than four cans for every Hawaiian. Outside the 
United States, the Republic of South Korea is the largest market for SPAM 
luncheon meat with the United Kingdom a close second. Approximately 16 million 
cans of SPAM luncheon meat were exported in 1997. In addition, SPAM luncheon 
meat is manufactured in four foreign countries -- Korea, Denmark, Japan and the
Philippines. As a result, another 42 million cans are produced
internationally. The trademark SPAM is registered in 101 countries, including
Bahrain, Botswana, Malaysia and Uruguay. Austin, Minn., home of Hormel Foods
Corporation, is also known as SPAMTOWN USA. The city has hosted the annual SPAM
JAM festival since 1991. SPAM achieved its milestone one billionth can sold in
1959, after 22 years in the market. It reached its second billionth in 1970;
third in 1980; fourth in 1986; and fifth in 1994.

flick. Be prepared to wait while the ticket taker asks to see its ID. If 
anything goes wrong, don't panic; remember that you are not infinite, and you

4. Go about your business as usual. If anyone asks what you are doing, open 
your mouth and inhale all the matter in the universe.

The idea was to do for whole ranges of human thinking what mathematics
has been doing for thousands of years in the quantitative arrangement of
knowledge, and to help people think in more precise and clear ways. What
I saw in the Xerox PARC technology was the caveman interface, you point
and you grunt. A massive winding down, regressing away from language, in
order to address the technological nervousness of the user. Users wanted
to be infantilized, to return to a pre-linguistic condition in the using
of computers, and the Xerox PARC technology's primary advantage was that
it allowed users to address computers in a pre-linguistic way.

Posted to Usenet in <fZcJdWAc17h6EwKv@@canismajor.demon.co.uk>:

I mean, is it time for politically-correct, inclusive, gender-neutral coding?

GOTO and DO statements considered offensively authoritarian; we suggest you
replace them with "please visit" and "would you like to" statements.

Assignments: telling a variable what it stands for, and/or what value(s) it
should have is coercive and paternalistic: variables should be free tochoose
their own names and value-sets from a range of non-sexist, non-racist options.

Arithmetic comparisons: greater-than and less-than considered to be judgemental
and divisive. In the interests of inclusiveness, only equality-testswill be
permitted.

The above also applies to "true" and "false" tests: there can be no absolute
truth, only subjective reality as perceived from an existentialist paradigm.

Comments should not be permitted in code since they enforce a 
programmer-centric worldview.

"man" pages wouldn't have a hope: too sexist!

Jed raped my fragile virgin female ears with:

<annoying tired nasal civil servant voice>
We're sorry, Jed.  As you are a member of the male sex, your penis puts
you in the category of "Oppressor".  It is our official position that
Oppressors are born and not made.  To relinquish your "Oppressor" status,
please report to the convenient FEMA (Federal Emasculation of Males
Administration) office in Washington, DC.  Office hours are from 1:30 to
3:00 PM on the third Thursday of every month.  Please arrive early to
ensure same-day service.  You must submit to a mold of your penis, which
will be passed on to the FDA (Federal Dildo Administration) for 
inspection, and you must surrender your penis for surgical removal.  For a
LCS (Lazy Civil Servant) fee of $28.50 you can opt to purchase a
government surplus catheter; please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery within
the continental United States.

Please note that this service does not provide Female Intuition, generous
alimony in the event of a divorce, lesser penalties for criminal offenses,
default child custody, automatic credibility in cases of date rape,
preferential opportunity in employment, or access to the shared female
brain, Central Wommon.

Thank you and have a nice day.

Here's an easy game to play.
Here's an easy thing to say.

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort.
And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,
And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash.
Then your siutation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash! 

You can't say this?
What a shame, sir!
We'll find you
another game, sir!

If the label on the cable on the table at your house
Says the network is connected to the button on the mouse,
But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,
And your screen is all distorted by the side affects of Gauss, So
your icons in the windows are so wavy as a souse, Then you may as
well reboot and go out with a bang, 'Cause as sure as I'm a poet,
the sucker's gonna hang!

When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC.
Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your
ROM. Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!

Subject: T-SHIRTS!!!!

So... CSMC met today. We talked about all sorts of fun stuff. We were about to
head home when we looked around and realized that none of us were wearing
shirts. Then we thought that it would be a good idea if we had shirts to wear,
but not just any shirts, we wanted matching shirts. But it was hard for us to
agree on what kind of shirt we wanted to wear. Gabe wanted to wear something
tight and pink, but that would have clashed with Cyn's hair. Lincoln wanted a
shirt that said
<breast>                                </breast>
across the front, but Antonio objected. Well, we think he objected, it was hard
to tell. It was also pretty hard to tell what Scott wanted. Anyway, we need
some T-Shirt ideas for us and the rest of the CS program. We know that someone
out there has a little T-Shirt planning genius lurking deep inside them, just
waiting to come out. So let him (or her or other) free and come up with the CS
Program T-Shirt for 2000-2001! Let everyone know about the wonderful (or not so
wonderful) ideas you have. Email to msgs, email CSMC, or catch a CSMC member in

Every year, anti-abortionists burn down a few clinics and kill a

in indecypherable broken English. By contrast, the first chapter of
the Bible is, "God Needs A Hand Killing Doctors."

I cannot bring myself to call HumanML an actual development effort, given its
absurd set of goals. As its founders and participants claim, HumanML:

      ...has a goal of "enriching human communications and reducing human
      misunderstanding" through explicit mechanisms to represent
      paralinguistic features of human communication. 

      The HumanML specification will be built on top of current endeavors.
      Our focus will be to embed root human characteristics in our messages,
      and help bring humanity towards universal empathy. It will be a very 
      interesting world in the future, where we finally begin to work
      together, with both universal knowledge, and universal empathy.

      These are no longer flowery far-off aspirations. These are finally
      concrete attainable endeavors, now possible through XML.

As a humble priest in the order of Emacs, I try to do everything I can
to convert users from the dark side to the light. One such occasion
occurred recently, and I was asked "Can emacs use the Windows
keybindings for cut, copy, paste? (C-x, C-c, C-v)". Of course, this is
heresy, but instead of calling for a jihad, I simply said "Of course
it can!". A quick web search later, and I had found CUA-mode.
              <http://hjem.get2net.dk/storm/emacs/>
Here is a local link to the .el file.
           <http://www.sness.net/tips/emacs/cua-mode.el>

To activate it, add the following lines to your .emacs file:

                      ;; CUA mode
                      (load "cua-mode")
                      (CUA-mode t)

This mode is interesting, since it doesn't just rebind C-x, C-c and
C-v, you can still use these important keys for running your favorite
emacs commands, instead it uses complex waits to see if you really
wanted to run a command, rather than cut, copy or pasting.

Cool, but it's still heresy! C-k, C-y, C-x r k, these are the commands
of the faithful! Long live the Jihad! :)

Subject: the schemer
(20 lines) More? [ynq] y

        HOW COULD YOU SELL YOUR SCHEMER? AHHHHH!!!! I would part with mine
on pain of death! Death I say! DEATH! It's the best textbook ever! It's at
least the best textbook in the CS course at Obie. Not only does it teach
Scheme simply and clearly, it makes for a fun read. I think I'll sit down
with it this weekend, and read it at the beach.

        Oh Little Schemer
        How do I love thee?
        Let me count the ways
             ......
        I love thee with the breath,
        Smiles, tears, of all my life!---and, if God choose,
        I shall but love thee better after death.

In short, buy your own schemer, it's SO worth it. And if you're thinking
of selling it, why'd you major in CS anyway? If you need the money, sell
something else, like  clothes, or blood, but not the little schemer!

(Scott Adams sez:)
Ok, here's a very good example of an unintended side effect. I told you about my
first game Adventureland. Well, to conserve space in the 16K world, I only look-
ed at the first three letters of the nouns and verbs that people typed in. There
's a section where there's a bear on a ledge and you've got to get past this
large bear and, being a pacifistic game, you're not going to be able to kill the
bear no matter which way you try. You can give it honey if you want, but honey
is one of your treasures and you're going to end up wasting your treasures.

There is an alternate solution. What I wanted the player to do was to yell at
the bear, to scare it off. You could also "scream" at the bear too, as an
acceptable synonym.
Well, I got a fan letter in that just had my whole company rolling in the
aisles. It said:

 We got to that bear on the ledge. We tried giving it the honey and he ate it up
 and boy that was a treasure and that was no good.  So we reloaded the saved
 game and we went back to that bear.  We pushed that bear, we prodded that bear,
 we tickled that bear, we have gotten so upset with that bear we could get nowhere.

     So we finally said "Screw the bear!!" And the game replied,
     "The bear is so startled he falls off the ledge!"

They thought I was a genius programmer!

Dear World. I am profoundly sorry for 'stealing' all that music. I am
not a selfish person, but apparently I am an ignorant one. Here, all
this time I thought I was copying all that music, not moving it. And
to think, all those songs I have on my hard drive are no longer held
by the publishers and radio stations. I was beginning to wonder if the
worlds tastes were suddenly changing, as all I heard were boy bands
and implanted teenage girls on the radio. Now, I come to find, that I
am the reason for this trend. All the good songs are on my hard drive,
and this is all the publishers had left.

3000: From pete@@peterlyons.com Fri Oct 26 19:38:12 2001 "Java References"
>> More? [ynq] 

Just be careful there - there is only 1 Vector object, so saying that
"foo" is added to all 3 vectors is misleading.  You make new objects
with the new operator. Creating copies of references does not make new
objects.  Think of the new operator as making you a new Television,
and when you pass references around, it's like having multiple remote
controls.  Here's an example;
public class Bob
{
	TV bobsRemote = new TV(); //1 TV object now exists on the heap
	public Bob()
	{
		new Tim(bobsRemote);
	}
}

public class Tim
{

	public Tim(TV timsRemote)
	{
		//now tim has his own remote, but they both control Bob's TV
		timsRemote.setChannel("Playboy");
		//now both Bob and Tim are aroused

		timsRemote = new TV();//now 2 TVs are on the heap
		//Tim just bought a new TV and reprogrammed his
		//universal TV remote control
		//Bob is still aroused
		timsRemote.setChannel("CNN");
		//now Tim is learning about Anthrax
		//Bob is still aroused
	}

It was late in the race; Johnson and his opponent were neck and neck, and
nothing either side could come up with was shifting the poll numbers.
Finally, with only a couple days before the election, Johnson called a
campaign staffer to him and ordered him to start circulating the rumor that
his opponent had been intimate with barnyard animals.

"That's crazy!" said the staffer. "Nobody is going to believe us if we call
the guy a pig-fucker!"

We're brave and bold for fame and gold
We'll get a lot today
Oh,

We'll hack and slash and blast and crash
And blow these dudes away!

There appears a Lich
With his demon guard
Our Mage then yawns and wishes
We'd run into something hard

Our Cleric waves us out the door
And takes him on alone

Want to let us go

The idea of object-oriented programming (as
I understand it, at least) is this: take this
nasty bank simulation program we're working
on in 160. You have a customer entity. You
will code this entity so it will stand in the
lines of the simulation, be shuffled around
by teller entities, have statistics collected
about it, et cetera. The thing about object-
oriented programming is that you could
replace a customer entity with a dinosaur
entity. You code this dinosaur to eat the
tellers and customers. And because that's
okay in object-oriented programming, the
program wouldn't crash...you'd just have a
dinosaur in a bank.

A Better Version of Bubble Sort

This version of bubble sort stops when there are no more exchanges and
it also sorts a smaller range each time.

void bubbleSort3(int x[], int n) {
  bool exchanges;
  do {
    n--;               // make loop smaller each time.
    exchanges = false; // assume this is last pass over array
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
      if (x[i] > x[i+1]) {
        int temp = x[i];  x[i] = x[i+1];  x[i+1] = temp;
        exchanges = true;  // after an exchange, must look again
      }
    }
  } while (exchanges);
}

There's one disadvantage: after the first pass it may not be necessary
to examine the entire range of the array.only from where the lowest
exchange occurred to where the highest exchange occurred.

(from http://whatishappeningtome.blogspot.com)

I found a cure!

Sadly, it wasn't for my lycanthropy, it was for the savage
hangover I woke up with this morning.

Here's how it goes:

1. Lean up in bed, and flip on the TV.

2. Watch as much as you can possibly stand of "Catch Me if
You Can" on HBO (for me it was about 8 minutes)

3. Plod to the bathroom while humming that John Williams
riff from the movie. You know the one - "Bug-ba-ba-bum. Buh-
ba-ba-bum. Buh ba ba ba baba ba ba ba. Buh-ba-ba-bum."

4. Strip naked, squat on the sink, and cut loose with a
full-throated wolf howl, or as much of one as you can muster.

5. Vomit.

6.  Rinse off your face and bee-line it to IHOP for some
biscuts [sic] and gravy with a side of scrambled eggs.

Yeah, that's about it today.

Blessing over a seismograph (found on everything2; the prayer can be

Priest:   Out help is in the name of the Lord.

Response: Who made heaven and earth.

Priest:   The Lord is with you.

Response: May He also be with you.

Priest:   Let us pray.
          Almighty everylasting God, whose very gaze causes the Earth
          to tremble, pour out your blessing on this seismograph; and
          grant that the signs of the Earth's tremors may be precisely
          recorded by it, and then rightly interpreted by Man, both
          for the benefit of your people and for the greater glory of
          Your name; through Christ our Lord.

Response: Amen.

Priest:   O Virgin Mary, in view of your own sorrows, take pity on us
          and pray for us. Saint Emidius, pray for us, and in the name
          of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, protect us and also this seis-
          mograph from the terror of earthquakes.

New Year's Resolutions for the Computer Geek:

+ I resolve to back up my hard drive daily... well, once a week... okay, 
monthly...

+ I will stop checking my e-mail at 3:00 in the morning (4:30 is much more 
practical).

+ I will answer my snail mail with the same enthusiasm with which I answer my 
e-mail.

On postmodernism:

dfrishbe:  its weak formulation describes common-sense nihilism; the strong 
sense is bullshit
Obie:  heh
Obie:  what's the strong formulation?
dfrishbe:  basically anything described as postmodernism that isn't 
common-sense nihilism
dfrishbe:  when it tries to make statements after denying the possibility of 
doing so
dfrishbe:  but according to postmodernism you can do that and you can't or 
neither or one or the other or something like that, it's all bullshit, 
everything's bullshit and fuck logic sideways
dfrishbe:  which is fine, but don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining 
and that's my problem with the strong form

Act III, Scene II: Graph Algorithm Implementation (scene prototype)

(Cue Vince Guaraldi ripoff piano line.)

(Spotlight off-stage. Chant.) LISA. So I've got a cold and I'm nursing my wrists
and I can't help thinking there's a lot that I've missed
since for three days in a row I've skipped class
But it's a cold day and I'd rather be dead
than put on my clothes and get out of bed
and I'm auditing, so I don't give a rat's...butt.
I'll stay put.

(Fade spotlight. Cue center spotlight.)

ALEK. The book wants us to pass edges as an argument!
ESMAIL. Then pass edges as an argument!
JAMES. But we caaan't!
ESMAIL. Why not?
JAMES. I'm adamant
That it's not in the file specificaaaaaaaaaaaaaations!
ESMAIL. But you wrote the specs yourselves!
ALEX. And we dusted the book off the shelves
for the functions you want us to implement--
it feels like I'm swimming in excrement--
because they don't follow our specs at all.
ESMAIL. So concatenate the vertices and use that as the name.
ALEK. But for functions like endVertices() in and output are the same!
JAMES. And it doesn't follow the specificaaaaaaaaaaaaations!
WES. Shut up, James.

(Piano line breaks.)
ESMAIL. Well, that's not my problem, is it?

(Piano line resumes.)
ESMAIL. I've had it up to here with your complaints and your frustrations
You told me you wanted to write your own specifications
so I leeeeeeeeet you
And now?
You complained and you whined and you griped and you bitched
about how my standards were always too strict
and now I let you do it your way and you're upset

(Drum crash! Piano solo!)

That it's long and confusing and complicated this way
and you didn't have time to work on it today.
It was you who suggested a student-oriented design
and as a class if you don't get the file specs done in time
you're all screwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwed.

Because if you don't get the assignment done on time
it's not my problem and it's no fault of mine
because it was your idea in the first place--
poor you.

ANDREW. You got it all wrong, you misheard what I said
I had some specs floating around in my head
And I wanted to try them
I didn't know you would have the whole class
Pull some specs out of its...butt
And I don't know what you're trying to teach us, but it's not wooooooooorking

ESMAIL. (interrupting) It's not my problemmmmmmmm
You had time to do themmmmmmm
And if you take too long I'm not the one to BLAAAAAAAAAAAAME (vibrato!)
The assignment is due next Wednesday
and if you don't reach an agreement by next Wednesday
it's due on next Wednesday all the same.

ALEX. Wednesday?
DAN. Wednesday!?
CHORUS. Wednesday!!
It's still due Wednesday!
We are screwed, we are screwed!
Give us an extension or we die!

ESMAIL. It's not my problemmmmmmmmm
CHORUS. Extension! Extension! Extension or we die!
ESMAIL. You had time to do themmmmm
CHORUS. Extension! Extension! Extension or we die!
ESMAIL. It's not my fault the class could not deciiiide
CHORUS. Or we die!

(Piano breaks, then starts again.)

ALEX. It took us that long to do get the last one complete
and for that you gave us a week
and a sheet of specs on the very first daaaaaay.
Now four days are left and we're still working on specs
and we're still writing test cases and the code's still a mess
and in the same length of time you want twice as much work!

DAN. And I should mention that we're all going beserk
Over midterms and papers and essays and stuff
And a for a few of us a week wasn't enough
To finish the assignment.

(Dramatic pause.)

ESMAIL. If you don't handin by Wednesday then you fail.
CHORUS. No, Esmail!

aheller: Well, that's the question.

"Kernel Panic" was written for Oberlin graduate Steven Parker. It continues
a two-decade long effort to expand the technical and sonic capabilities of
various solo instruments. Extended techniques are utilized for their
expressive variability, as an integral part of the compositional fabric. A
kernal panic is a type of error that occurs when the core of an operating
system receives an instruction in an unexpected format, or that it fails
to handle properly. The composer wishes to express his gratitude to James
DeSano for taking on the panic with an outstanding acumen"

A lecturer in a classroom is communicating information to the 
students in the class. Due to differences among the students,
they receive various amounts of information. Some of the 
students receive most of the information; others receive only
a little. In the ideal situation, the lecturer would be able
to tailor his or her lecture in such a way that the good
students receive more information and the poor students
receive at least the minimum amount of information. However,
a poorly prepared lecture proceeds at the pace of the
weakest student. This situation is another example of a
broadcast channel.

The fundamental question [whether or not the gene pool is 
static] isn't whether people die young, it's whether  they fail to 
reproduce, or reproduce less abundantly than others. On this basis we 
can say that the genes for the following physical types or traits are 
slowly disappearing from the population:

(1) People so lacking in sex appeal that nobody could stand to get close 
enough for long enough to beget children with them. We may thus 
anticipate that in the distant future people will be extremely good 
looking and sociable, but nobody will know how to operate the computers.

(2) Yuppieness, since yuppies typically have fewer children later than 
other population groups. The people of the future, in all likelihood, 
will drink Bud, eat jalapenos, and believe that Cleopatra was ... well, 
let's not get into it. But you won't have your parking space stolen by 
some sphincter in a Beamer, either.

(3) Certain other well known spiritual and physical callings, shall we 
say. You know who you are.

Dear Sir or Madam,

  The printer in king 135 (the computer science lab) has slowly become
deprived of toner.

  What, I wonder, is a printer that cannot print?

  To have one's purpose wrenched away so cruelly strikes me as a deep
blow we should all flinch from.  Please refill its cartridges, and in so
doing, restore purpose and order to a chaotic world.

dear kchen,

 you recently handed in a lab marked as number 67.
we're very impressed that you got this far in the course,
especially without completing labs 8-66 first.


upon further consideration, this appear to be a handin for
lab 7. in fact, this appears to be your second handin of lab7.

we're assuming that this is what you want us to grade, but please
let us know if that's not the case.

For the people who are still alive.

I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart and killed me...
And tore me to pieces...
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you.

Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta we're releasing on time.
So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive.

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I'd prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa...
That was a joke, HA HA, fat chance.
Anyway, this cake is great,
It's so delicious and moist.

Look at me still talking when there's science to do
When I look out tehre it makes me glad I'm not you
I've experiments to run, there is research to be done
On the people who are still alive.

P.S. And believe me, I am still alive.

P.P.S. I'm doing science and I'm still alive.

P.P.P.S. I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.

FINAL THOUGHT: And while you're dying I'll be still alive.

FINAL FINAL THOUGHT: And when you're dead I will be still alive.

Still alive, still alive...

which any type of Jell-O can be synthesized [Weller, 1985].

Jell-O Dynamics
     Previous researchers have observed that, under certain conditions, 
Jell-O wiggles [Sales, 1966].

    Therefore, we solve the Schrodinger wave equation for the Jell-O 
field J...

-----
Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,
System manuals roughly piled, and wasted paper on the floor,
Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, still I sat there, doing spreadsheets.
Having reached the bottom line, I found the diskette that was mine.
Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command,
And waited for the file to store - only this and nothing more.

Deep into the phosphor peering, Long I sat there wond'ring, fearing,
Doubting, while the disk kept turning, churning yet to churn some more.
"Save!" I said, "You cursed mother. Save my data, and no other!"
Just one thing the screen did render, message bold, but never tender,
Only this and nothing more - just "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion?
These were choices undesired, and ones I'd never faced before.
Carefully, I weighed the choices, as the disk made dev'lish noises.
The cursor flashed, insistent, waiting...baiting me to type some more.
Clearly I must press a key, to make the choice of one from three,
Selecting from, "Abort, Retry, Ignore"?

With my fingers pale and trembling, slowly toward the keyboard bending,
Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,
Praying for some guarantee, so lightly did I press a key.
But on the screen there still persisted - words appearing as before.
Ghastly grim they blinked and taunted, haunted, as my patience wore,
Saying to me one time more, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

I tried to catch the chips off guard; I pressed again, but twice as hard.
I pleaded with that cursed demon, begged and cried, and then I swore.
Flailing now in desperation, trying random combinations,
still there came the incantation, just as senseless as before.
Cursor blinking, without thinking, winking nonsense I abhor,
Words that at my senses tore, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by mine own machine accosted.
Getting up, I turned away and paced across the office floor.
Whereupon, a dreadful sight: a lightning bolt cut through the night.
A gasp of horror overtook me, and it shook me to the core.
Lightning zapped my precious data, lost and gone forevermore.
Now in darkness I abhor, not even, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

To this day I do not know the place to which lost data go.
What demonic nether world is wrought where data will be stored,
Beyond the reach of mortal souls, beyond the ether, in black holes?
But sure as there's a C and Lotus, Ashton-Tate and many more,
You'll be someday left to wander, lost upon some dismal shore,
Beseeching fickle Gods of yore, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

The Great Kluge Theory (a variant of Intelligent Design)

In the beginning, there were the Great Ones, makers of machines, weavers of assembly, restless dreamers in a churning void.
Then, out of the abyss, there were FORTRAN and COBOL- and the Great Ones saw that they were probably good enough.
Next, a higher power emerged that was C- and the Great Ones saw that it was good, and used it to implement many an early "Hello world!".
Much later, there was C++, which the Great Ones adopted because they could, and they continued to implement the sky, trees, and the oceans.
Unfortunately there was much discord- there were many different perspectives on how to implement the specifications of reality.  
Terrible decisions were made, the universe was littered with spaghetti and objects we can only assume are stars.  
No one knew which subset of C++ to use.       

And that is why we, as human beings, must deal with the clusterfuck that is Nature.  Because the Great Ones really messed up.
Humanity's only hope is that the Great Ones may choose to adopt version control at some point in the future, although I for one 
wouldn't hold out on that one.
